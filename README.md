# Iris Flower Classification Project

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal attributes. 
Iris flower classification is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and serves as a great introduction to various classification techniques.

# Introduction:
The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning. It consists of three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. 
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify these species based on the measurements of their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Techniques Used
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and checked for missing values. Feature scaling and normalization were applied to ensure that all features have similar scales.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of each feature and the relationships between features.

3. Machine Learning Algorithms: Various classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors were employed.

4. Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess their performance.

 # Results
After evaluating various models, the achieved an accuracy of 99% on the test dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in classifying Iris flowers into their respective species.
